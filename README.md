# Tap Room
#### _A web application using React created on 04/26/2019 by Theary Im_

## Description
A web application for a bar to track their kegs.

**Note on the differences between Angular and React:**
. Angular uses two directional data flow process where it updates the real DOM directly while React updates only the virtual DOM and is concerned with the one directional data flow.

## Specs
1. A user can see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, a user can see its name, brand, price and alcohol content.
2. A user can fill out a form when they tap a new keg to add it to the list.
3. A user can edit a keg's properties after entering them in the case mistake was made.
4. A user can click a button next to a keg whenever they sell a pint of it. The number of pints will decrease by 1.
5. A user can see the kegs with less than 10 pints left so they can be ready to change them.
6. The kegs are color-coded based on price.
7. The kegs are color-coded based on the alcohol content.
